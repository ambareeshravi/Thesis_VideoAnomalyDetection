    """
    Finds extrema and their persistence in one-dimensional data.
    
    Local minima and local maxima are extracted, paired,
    and returned together with their persistence.
    The global minimum is extracted as well.

    We assume a connected one-dimensional domain.
    Think of "data on a line", or a function f(x) over some domain xmin <= x <= xmax.
    We are only concerned with the data values f(x)
    and do not care to know the x positions of these values,
    since this would not change which point is a minimum or maximum.
    
    This function returns a list of extrema together with their persistence.
    The list is NOT sorted, but the paired extrema can be identified, i.e.,
    which minimum and maximum were removed together at a particular
    persistence level. As follows:
    The odd entries are minima, the even entries are maxima.
    The minimum at 2*i is paired with the maximum at 2*i+1.
    The last entry of the list is the global minimum.
    It is not paired with a maximum.
    Hence, the list has an odd number of entries.
