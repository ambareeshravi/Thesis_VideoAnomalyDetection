# Thesis_VideoAnomalyDetection
My Thesis work related to video anomaly detection

This repo contains the experiments for the following papers:

1. "Kernel Strengthening and Structural Similarity for Improving Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Images", Ambareesh Ravi, Qiang Zhao, Fakhri Karray, _Pattern Recognition, Elsevier. **[Under review]**_

2. "ATTENTIVE AUTOENCODERS FOR IMPROVING VISUAL ANOMALY DETECTION", Ambareesh Ravi, Fakhri Karray, _IEEE ICAS2021 [Accepted]_

3. "AutoEncoder regularization using Support Vector Data Description for Anomaly Detection", Ambareesh Ravi, Fakhri Karray, _IEEE SMC2021 [Submitted]_

4. "Exploring Convolutional Recurrent Architectures for anomaly detection in videos", Ambareesh Ravi, Fakhri Karray, _Discover Artificial Intelligence, Springer [Submitted]_


Notes:
1. The repo is not documented since it was originally written for research and rapid experimenation [will document the code soon]. But most coding standards are followed
2. Repo is not continuously maintained and will remain frozen
3. There are a few "ambitious" experiments that might not work
4. Use any code starting with "run_" in AutoEncoders/ to run experiments
